## Introduction

This is a student project by Lisa M. Venezia that will help me practice coding using Object Oriented Javascript.  
The finished project is a Frogger-like game where the player has to cross to the water without getting hit by a bug!

## Features

The following features are included in this arcade game:
- A playing field is presented to the user.
- The player character is rendered on the screen and the user can move the player by manipulating the arrow keys.
- Enemy bugs are rendered on the screen and can move at three different speeds.
- Game ends when either the player makes it to the water or the player collides with a bug.

## How to Play

To play the game, download the files into a folder, and open the index.html file in your browser.  You are the girl at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to get to the water.

If you play wisely and watch your step, you'll win the game when you reach the water!  Game will the reset, and you can play again!

If you touch a bug by mistake, the game is over.  Play will reset, and you can try again.

## Dependencies
This project was created based on sample code provided by Udacity (http://www.udacity.com).
