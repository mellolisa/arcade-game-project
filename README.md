## Introduction

This is a student project by Lisa M. Venezia that will help me practice coding using Object Oriented Javascript.  
The finished project is a Frogger-like game where the player has to cross to the water without getting hit by a bug!

## Features

The following features are included in this arcade game:
- A playing field is presented to the user.
- The player character is rendered on the screen and the user can move the player by manipulating the arrow keys.
- Enemy bugs are rendered on the screen and can move at three different speeds.
- Game ends when either the player makes it to the water or the player collides with a bug.

## Dependencies
This project was created based on sample code provided by Udacity (http://www.udacity.com).
